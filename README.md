### Qt.py

Qt.py enables you to write software that dynamically chooses the most desireable bindings based on what's available, including PySide, PySide2, PyQt4 and PyQt5.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Install

Qt.py is a single file and can either be downloaded as-is or installed via PyPI.

```bash
$ pip install Qt.py
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Usage

Use Qt.py as you would use PyQt5 or PySide2.

```python
import sys
from Qt import QtWidgets

app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
button = QtWidgets.QPushButton("Hello World")
button.show()
app.exec_()
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

### How it works

Once you import Qt.py, Qt.py replaces itself with the most desirable binding on your platform, or throws an `ImportError` if none are available.

```python
>>> import Qt
>>> print(Qt)
<module 'PyQt5' from 'C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\PyQt5\__init__.pyc'>
```

Here's an example of how this works.

**Qt.py**

```python
import sys
import PyQt5

# Replace myself PyQt5
sys.modules["Qt"] = PyQt5
```

Once imported, it is as though your application was importing whichever binding was chosen and Qt.py never existed.

### Documentation

All members of `Qt` stem directly from those available via PySide2, along with these additional members.

```python
import Qt

# A string reference to binding currently in use
Qt.__binding__ == 'PyQt5'

# Reference to version of Qt, such as Qt 5.6.1
Qt.__qt_version__ == '5.6.1'

# Reference to version of binding, such as PySide 1.2.6
Qt.__binding_version__ == '1.2.6'

# Version of this project
Qt.__wrapper_version__ == '1.0.0'
```

**Branch binding-specific code**

Some bindings offer features not available in others, you can use `__binding__` to capture those.

```python
if "PySide" in Qt.__binding__:
  do_pyside_stuff()
```

**Override preferred choice**

If your system has multiple choices, one of which is preferred, you can override the dynamic discovery mechanism with this environment variable.

```bash
# Windows
$ set QT_PREFERRED_BINDING=PyQt5
$ python -c "import Qt;print(Qt.__binding__)"
PyQt5

# Unix/OSX
$ export QT_PREFERRED_BINDING=PyQt5
$ python -c "import Qt;print(Qt.__binding__)"
PyQt5
```

**Load Qt Designer .ui files**

The `uic.loadUi` function of PyQt4 and PyQt5 as well as the `QtUiTools.QUiLoader().load` function of PySide/PySide2 are mappend to a convenience function `load_ui`.

```python
import sys
from Qt import QtWidgets
from Qt import load_ui


class Hello(QtWidgets.QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Hello, self).__init__()
        self.ui = load_ui('my_ui.ui')

app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
window = Hello()
window.ui.show()
sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

Please note, for maximum compatibility, only pass the argument of the filename to the `load_ui` function.
